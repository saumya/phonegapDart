Making phonegap applications with DART (and its packages)

This is a self learnign project and I must say it took me 5 days from start to finish. By that I mean learning Dartlang, and its workflow and its packages to learning a Cordova Android application.

Technology :
1. Dartlang (and Rikulo package)
2. Phonegap ( version 2.3)
